## How to Import?

Oh its Easy! You need to Download the Files from the [addon-list.md](addon-list.md "mention")or from the Discord.

You have in the Customer Dashboard the Tab Files. Customer -> Files

And there you can Upload the folder Commands/Buttons/Modals/Selectmenus.&#x20;

* Drag and Drop the Folders

Now Restart the Bot and Test the Addon!
